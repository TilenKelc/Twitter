- or you can login with facebook or google,
- make posts (they can contain either text or picture or both), 
- comment/reply to posts,
- like different posts,
- follow people and let other people follow you,
- see the people who are following you, who you are following and the posts you liked,
- you can edit your profile and upload your profile picture,
- the administrator can also delete posts.
